### Hi there 👋

My name is Tim. I clean and analyze data, and like to build tools to make that easier. 
I work [Hudl](http://hudl.com/) helping coaches and athletes win. 
I'm at home programming in R, but I also really enjoy Python. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [feat](https://github.com/tmastny/feat), a Python package to help with feature importances in sklearn. 
- ⏭️ Up next, I'm updating my AWS [sagemaker](https://github.com/tmastny/sagemaker) to make it easy to productionize machine learning models in R.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the IPython API and [auto-completion](https://github.com/machow/siuba/pull/249) for [siuba](https://github.com/machow/siuba).
- 📖 I recently learned Hugo and updated the layout of my [blog](https://timmastny.rbind.io/).
- 💬 Ask me about AWS and R.
